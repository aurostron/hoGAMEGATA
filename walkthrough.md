## 2026-08-13 — Omnisync Harness Setup

### Summary
Installed the Omnisync agentic coding harness into the `gamegata-v1` project directory, establishing the append-only change-log convention and setting up the `.opencode` environment and subagents.

### Files Modified
| File | Action |
|------|--------|
| `AGENTS.md` | Modified — Integrated Omnisync change-log rule alongside Next.js notice |
| `CLAUDE.md` | Modified — Integrated Omnisync change-log rule with Astro dev guidelines |
| `.agents/AGENTS.md` | Modified — Integrated Omnisync change-log rule into agent preferences |
| `.opencode/.gitignore` | NEW — Ignored package manager artifacts |
| `.opencode/instructions.md` | NEW — OpenCode project instructions with change-log rule |
| `.opencode/agents/web-search.md` | NEW — Autonomous web research subagent |
| `walkthrough.md` | NEW — Project walkthrough change log initialized with initial harness setup entry |

### Design Decisions / Rationale
- Configured project-level rules across `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.agents/AGENTS.md`, and `.opencode/instructions.md` to ensure any AI agent operating on `gamegata-v1` adheres to the append-only documentation standard.
- Maintained existing project preferences and Astro development instructions.

### Verification
- Verified directory structure and file contents using PowerShell `Get-ChildItem` and file inspections.

## 2026-08-16 — API Security Hardening & Abuse Prevention

### Summary
Comprehensive hardening of all 25 public API endpoints following penetration test and abuse surface audit. Implemented KV-based rate limiting, fixed 3 critical authentication/authorization bypasses, enforced authentication on game likes, added Cloudflare Turnstile CAPTCHA to bug submissions, enforced server-side `userId` verification for edit suggestions, prevented CSRF on logout by transitioning to POST, and disabled legacy waitlist registration.

### Files Modified
| File | Action |
|------|--------|
| `src/lib/rateLimit.ts` | NEW — Cloudflare KV sliding-window rate limiter utility |
| `wrangler.jsonc` | Modified — Bound `RATE_LIMIT` KV namespace (`b4f797e76c9545d6aa41ea80be9ddb5a`) |
| `src/pages/api/maintenance/toggle.ts` | Modified — Removed spoofable `Referer` auth bypass, converted to POST-only |
| `src/pages/api/discord/interactions.ts` | Modified — Enforced hard-fail on missing `DISCORD_PUBLIC_KEY` & invalid signatures |
| `src/pages/api/auth/dev-bypass.ts` | Modified — Added `import.meta.env.DEV` guard (returns 404 in production) |
| `src/pages/api/game/likes.ts` | Modified — Enforced session authentication (`getServerUser`) and added rate limiting |
| `src/pages/api/edits/suggest.ts` | Modified — Enforced server-side `userId` verification and rate limiting (5 req/10 min) |
| `src/pages/api/bugs/submit.ts` | Modified — Integrated Turnstile CAPTCHA verification and rate limiting (3 req/hr) |
| `src/components/bugs/BugReportModal.tsx` | Modified — Added Turnstile CAPTCHA widget to bug report modal UI |
| `src/pages/api/search/click.ts` | Modified — Added rate limiting (30 req/min) |
| `src/pages/api/track/click.ts` | Modified — Added rate limiting (20 req/min) |
| `src/pages/api/waitlist/join.ts` | Modified — Disabled endpoint permanently (returns 410 Gone) |
| `src/pages/api/auth/logout.ts` | Modified — Converted from GET to POST to eliminate CSRF logout vulnerability |
| `src/pages/api/auth/token-login.ts` | Modified — Added rate limiting against token brute-force (5 req/15 min) |
| `src/layouts/AdminLayout.astro` | Modified — Updated logout link to submit via POST form |
| `src/pages/admin/verify-2fa.astro` | Modified — Updated logout link to submit via POST form |
| `src/context/AuthContext.tsx` | Modified — Added POST `/api/auth/logout` server call during logout flow |
| `src/pages/api/image-proxy.ts` | Modified — Added rate limiting (60 req/min) |
| `src/pages/api/game/credits.ts` | Modified — Added rate limiting (20 req/min) |
| `src/pages/api/protondb/fetch.ts` | Modified — Added rate limiting (20 req/min) and edge cache-control headers |
| `src/pages/api/search/web.ts` | Modified — Added non-dev environment guard (404 Not available) |
| `src/pages/api/games/index.ts` | Modified — Capped `sort=title` max limit from 20000 to 500 records |

### Design Decisions / Rationale
- **Sliding-window KV rate limiter**: Implemented in `src/lib/rateLimit.ts` leveraging Cloudflare KV with TTL auto-expiry and fail-open resilience to prevent accidental outages on KV faults while stopping high-frequency bot abuse.
- **Strict Server Auth Verification**: Replaced reliance on client-supplied body payloads (`body.userId`) with authenticated session tokens (`getServerUser`) on mutation endpoints to defeat identity spoofing and unauthorized reputation auto-approvals.
- **CSRF Defense**: Converted `/api/auth/logout` to POST to eliminate `<img src="/api/auth/logout">` image-tag CSRF traps.

### Verification
- Ran full production build (`npm run build`) — static sitemap, search index, and Cloudflare Worker bundle compiled with 0 errors.
- Verified Cloudflare `RATE_LIMIT` KV namespace creation via Wrangler CLI.

## 2026-08-16 — Enforce Client-Side Authentication on Likes and Wishlist Toggles

### Summary
Fixed optimistic guest interaction vulnerability where unauthenticated/incognito users could click Favorite / Like buttons and see optimistic state updates locally without logging in. Enforced strict authentication checks and automatic login redirect on all client components handling favorites, likes, and ratings.

### Files Modified
| File | Action |
|------|--------|
| `src/components/TrackControls.tsx` | Modified — Enforced `handleAuthRedirect()` when `!user` on `toggleWishlist` and `handleRatingChange`, preventing optimistic guest likes |
| `src/components/GameCatalogClient.tsx` | Modified — Added `!user` authentication redirect on card favorite toggle |
| `src/components/TabCatalog.tsx` | Modified — Added `!user` authentication redirect on tab game favorite toggle |
| `src/components/HeroCarousel.tsx` | Modified — Added `!user` authentication redirect on hero carousel favorite toggle |
| `src/components/StorefrontLists.tsx` | Modified — Added `!user` authentication redirect on storefront game favorite toggle |

### Design Decisions / Rationale
- Removed optimistic guest liking and guest `/api/game/likes` fallback from `TrackControls.tsx`. If a user is not authenticated (`!user`), interacting with Favorite/Like redirects to `/login?redirect=...`.
- Aligned all client-side favorite toggles across catalog, hero carousel, tabs, and game pages with the backend authentication requirement.

### Verification
- Ran production build (`npm run build`) successfully with 0 errors.

## 2026-08-16 — Fix Game Screenshots and Cover Image Rendering (Cloudinary 401 & Image Proxy)

### Summary
Fixed broken cover images and screenshot galleries on game pages (such as `/game/itch-backrooms-out-of-oxygen`). Resolved root cause where `getCloudinaryFetchUrl` was wrapping trending game URLs with Cloudinary's `image/fetch` feature which returned 401 Unauthorized for third-party hosting domains (`catbox.moe`, `iili.io`, etc.). Re-routed all remote game images through our Cloudflare Edge image proxy (`/api/image-proxy`), expanded `ALLOWED_HOSTS` domain whitelist, and increased proxy rate limits for screenshot galleries.

### Files Modified
| File | Action |
|------|--------|
| `src/lib/utils.ts` | Modified — Removed failing `res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch` route for trending games; routed all remote images through `/api/image-proxy?v=2&url=...` |
| `src/pages/api/image-proxy.ts` | Modified — Expanded `ALLOWED_HOSTS` to include itch.io, giphy, unsplash, and akamai CDN domains; raised rate limit from 60 to 600 req/min for gallery browsing |

### Design Decisions / Rationale
- Cloudinary free tier accounts reject unauthorized `image/fetch` proxying on third-party image domains. Our Cloudflare Worker image proxy already supports CDN-level 1-year immutable caching and handles external host fetching reliably without external account restrictions.
- Raised image proxy rate limit from 60 to 600 req/min so loading games with 12+ high-res screenshots never triggers rate-limiting false positives.

### Verification
- Tested `/api/image-proxy` against `catbox.moe` and `iili.io` URLs — returned `200 OK` with `Content-Type: image/webp` and `image/png`.
- Ran full production build (`npm run build`) — compiled with 0 errors.
